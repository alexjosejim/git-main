Folder names with multiple words
In our example, the folder should be called "Second semester." We've just created a folder called "School" in order to stay organized. In theory, I'd run mkdir Second semester to create a folder inside called "Second semester," right?

Nope! ðŸ˜–  You need to make special considerations for folder names that contain spaces.

Notice that, by running  mkdir  Second semester  , two folders (1. "Second," 2. "Semester") are created instead of one:

By running mkdir Second semester, I've accidentally created 2 files: one called "Second" and one called "semester." This is because my computer interprets the space between the two words as a delineation between two folders names, not just a space in the middle of one name.

Clearly, we need a different way to indicate "Second semester" is all one file name; not two separate ones.
