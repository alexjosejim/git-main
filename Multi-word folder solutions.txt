Multi-word folder solutions
To create or reference a folder with multiple words in it, you have three options:

use quotation marks, i.e.,  mkdir "Second semester"

This says the folder name should include all characters inside the quotation marks.

escape the special character (the character you're computer is interpreting in a special way) using a backslash, i.e, mkdir Second\ semester

This says that the special meaning of the space between "Second" and "semester" should be ignored. We want a space to just be a literal space, not for Terminal to interpret it as a way to separate multiple folder names.

In programming, you'll often use backslashes to escape special characters!

use hyphens instead of spaces to create a different folder name entirely (i.e.,  mkdir Second-semester  )
